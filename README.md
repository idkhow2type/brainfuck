# Brainfuck
Brainfuck is very a simple but Turing-complete programming language with 8 instructions. This repository contains various things I made related to Brainfuck

## Interpreters
I've made interpreters for this language in 
- Python
- [Scratch3](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/560182661/)
- Desmos graphing calculator

## Programs
I've also made a few little programs in brainfuck, some off them are listed here
- `minus.bf` a (probably over complicated) program that takes in 2 characters, compare and subtracts their ascii code and outputs it
- `draw.bf` a program that displays black and white RLE compressed images of a set width and height, pausing after each image <sup><sub>(It's Bad Apple)</sub></sup>
